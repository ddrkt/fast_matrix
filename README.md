# FastMatrix

Ruby wrapper around C matrices implementation written as exercise by two MMCS students.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fast_matrix'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fast_matrix

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

### Differences with the standard matrix
* Supported only double values
* Can't be empty
* Some faster

## Development

Fast matrix is native extension in C, so, for development you need Linux (maybe, MacOS) or Docker.

After checking out the repo, run `gem install bundler -v 2.0.2`, `bundle install` and `bundler exec rake` or use `Dockerfile`.

Commands:
  + `bundler exec rake compile` - compile C part of gem;
  + `bundler exec rake test` - run tests;
  + `bundler exec rake test TESTOPTS='-v'` - run tests with more information (description skipped tests);
  + `bundler exec rake` - compile and run tests.


To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
